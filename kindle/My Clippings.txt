Americans throw out 4.5 pounds of stuff per day, a number that is still increasing. (And remember, that is only your personal stuff that goes to landfill; if we added all of the roads and bridges and your share of the shopping malls and movie theaters you use, it is more like 100 pounds a day!) Even more astonishingly, every American uses an average of 6 tons of fossil fuel per year, which amounts to around 40 pounds per day of carbon, or more than 100 pounds per day of CO2. As we are all learning, there is no “away” to throw it all.

They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.” “Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.” “No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working.
